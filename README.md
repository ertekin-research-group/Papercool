## Process 

Begin by using this repository as a template to create a new repository for your paper. 
The new repo is to be created within the ertekin-research-group organization. 

There are four phases: 
  - identify paper theme, write the abstract, and make the figures. 
  - outline your paper around the figures. 
  - fill in the text to make a coherent document 
  - finalize items required for paper submisssion. 
  
The phases are tied to issues, which you should track using ZenHub. 

For each phase, you will complete the necessary tasks and carry out the required reviews with your review team. 
You should work with your review team until everyone believes that all the required elements for the phase are in place.  
At this point, you can submit a pull request for your repository.
