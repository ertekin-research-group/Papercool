# papercool

Use this template directory to write the coolest paper on the internet. 

## Process 

Begin by using this repository as a template to create a new private repository for your paper. 
The new repo is to be created within the ertekin-research-group organization. 

There are four phases: 
  - phase 1: identify paper theme, write the abstract, and make the figures. 
  - phase 2: outline your paper around the figures. 
  - phase 3: fill in the text to make a coherent document 
  - phase 4: finalize items required for paper submisssion. 
  
The phases are tied to issues, which you should track using ZenHub. 

For each phase, you will complete the necessary tasks and carry out the required reviews with your review team. 
You should work with your review team until everyone believes that all the required elements for the phase are in place.  
At this point, you can submit a pull request for your repository. 

## Step by Step Guide (in case you are new to this process) 

First, create a github account for yourself and send me your id so I can invite you to the ertekin-research-group organization. 

Look at [the guide](https://guides.github.com/), especially [Understanding the GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).  

Once you have been invited to ertekin-research-group, install [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) as a broswer extension. 
This is free for academic use. 

Go to the papercool repository and click on 'use this template' to create the repository for your paper. 
Select 'ertekin-research-group' as the owner, and give your repository a short but descriptive name that indicates the paper author and topic. Make the repository private. 

By default, this repository has one branch named 'master'. This will be the main branch for your paper. 

Once the repository is created, select the ZenHub tab within it. Switch your workspace to 'Writing a Cool Paper'. This should automatically import issues into ZenHub associated with each phase. 

Clone the repo to your local computer and work here together with your review team. Commit your changes often often. Once you are satisfied that the materials are ready for review by me, let me know and I will look them over. 

## Template files provided and integration with overleaf

The example .tex, .bib, and .pdf files included here could be used as a starting point, if you wish.  They need not be used.  The document classs 'achemso' is from the American Chemical Society.  Depending on what journal you are intend to submit your work, you may wish to change this.  It can always be changed later.
